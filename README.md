# Topological-features-of-grains
Accessing the topological features (face classes) of grains constituting polycrystalline microstructure using object detection technique.

This Repository includes script for an object detection tool which can be employed to realise the topological features of the grains that constitute
a polycrystalline system. Besides the script, the training and test data used to develop and assess the approach is appended. 

Note: Minor changes reflecting the local environment must be made for successful execution of the present approach.
